# AbsherThon - Python Requirements
# This project uses minimal Python dependencies

# Core Requirements
# Python 3.8+ (built-in http.server module)
# No external Python packages required for the main dashboard

# Optional: For development and testing
# If you want to use a more advanced server, you can install:
# flask>=2.3.0
# gunicorn>=21.0.0

# Note: The main application runs on Python's built-in http.server
# No pip install needed for basic functionality

# For the Next.js version (aun-agent/), see package.json instead
